##### Research profile

I develop numerical relativity simulations for the next generation of
gravitational wave detectors, such as the
[LISA space mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/LISA).
I co-lead the development of
[SpECTRE](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre), our next-generation
numerical relativity code that combines discontinuous Galerkin methods with
massive parallelism.

For details, see my [website](https://nilsvu.de).

##### Biography

I received my Ph.D. from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics
(AEI) Potsdam, Germany under the supervision of Harald Pfeiffer.
I am now a Burke Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech.
